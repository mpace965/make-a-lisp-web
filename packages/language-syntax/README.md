# language-syntax

This package defines the abstract syntax tree used by the interpreter to execute programs. The syntax tree nodes and values contained in them are persistent immutable data structures, provided by [immutable-js](https://immutable-js.com/).

## Node Types

* Boolean
* Hash Map
* Keyword
* List
* Nil
* Number
* String
* Symbol
* Vector

## TODO

The [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) implementation is still in progress. Eventually, all node types defined there should be supported
